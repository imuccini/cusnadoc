## Login FAQ

**Answer:** If you are a current student, your login credentials have been provided by the school. You will need to go to the appropriate school-owned portal to request your username and password.



**Question:** Can I have a router?\

This includes MiFi-type routers that use cellular data, as the router will still broadcast on a wireless channel that will interfere with the larger Wi-Fi network. Users do not need routers, as their devices will be on the users' individual Personal Area Network, allowing their wireless devices to communicate securely within the wireless network. If you currently utilize a router, you will be required to disconnect the equipment in order to remove the interference impacting other users on the network.
