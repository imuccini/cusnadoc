# BYOD

In most corporate networks, the conventional method to deliver BYOD connectivity relies on a **captive portal** paired with corporate SSO. Employees use a web-based login process each time they join the network, which is secure and familiar. However, this “as-is” solution comes with several challenges that have become more pronounced over time.

One major issue is that modern operating systems increasingly **randomize MAC addresses** to protect user privacy. This MAC rotation forces users to re-enroll every time their device’s identity changes, creating a frustrating cycle of repeated logins and credential revalidation. Additionally, because **each device must undergo its own enrollment process** via the captive portal, the overall user experience suffers when employees carry multiple personal devices. This situation becomes even more complicated for **headless devices**—like medical monitors or IoT sensors—that lack a traditional user interface. Such devices are typically incompatible with captive portal mechanisms, leaving them unable to connect through these conventional means. Moreover, the use of **open networks**, even with captive portals, is no longer acceptable from a security standpoint; organizations today require more robust solutions that ensure every connection is both authenticated and monitored.

PPSK offers a transformative alternative that directly addresses these issues. With PPSK, network access is secured through the assignment of unique pre-shared keys that are tied to an individual’s identity during a **one-time enrollment process**. This key can then be used seamlessly across all of an employee’s devices, effectively eliminating the need for repeated re-enrollment—even when MAC addresses rotate. Because the authentication mechanism is based on a pre-shared key rather than a device’s MAC address, it also readily supports **headless devices,** which can now connect without any interface-based challenges. Furthermore, by moving away from a reliance on open or captive portal-based connections, PPSK offers a far more **secure network environment**. The centralized management of keys also means that administrators benefit from enhanced **visibility**, robust **access control**, and detailed **connection logs**, ensuring **accountability** at every step. A significant advantage of this centralized approach is the facilitation of **cross-branch roaming**; employees can move seamlessly between locations without any additional configuration steps, making the network both agile and secure.

In summary, transitioning to a PPSK solution not only simplifies the enrollment process—ensuring one-time setup for all devices—but also overcomes the shortcomings of MAC rotation and captive portal limitations. The result is a more secure, user-friendly, and administratively efficient way to manage BYOD in today’s diverse workplace.
