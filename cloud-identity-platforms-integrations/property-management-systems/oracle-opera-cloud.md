## User experience

The WiFI portal can be distributed via in-room QR codes or published on a dedicated SSID as a captive portal.

Guests can sign in using their Last Name and Room number and get immediate access to the portal where theyâ€™ll can find their personal WiFi passphrase. If PAN is enabled, all devices connected with the same PSK will be in the same network segment (e.g. mobile phones, laptops and personal headless device such as gaming consoles, medical devices, etc..)
