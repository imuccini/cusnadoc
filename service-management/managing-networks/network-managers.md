# Network Managers

Network Managers can be invited by Organization Managers while creating a new Network or later while editing a Network.

One Network Manager can be assigned as manager of multiple Networks.

Once invited, new Network managers receives an invite email and they are prompted to create their own password. Existing Network managers that are added as managers to existing Network and notified via email.



Once logged in, Network managers can see only some of the menu and features that Organization manager see and in general they only see data and settings related to the Networks they are managed of.

In particular they see:

* **Home** (without the widget reporting data about Networks )
* **Accounts**: Networks Manager can only see Account related to Networks they manage and they can create and edit only accounts of those Networks.
