# Support platforms integrations

Cusna allows you to integrate your existing end customer support systems directly into the WiFi Portal, to provide end user a direct access to your support channels.

## Setup

You first need to setup the integration with your support platform in the **Setup**, **Integration page**.

Once you have setup the integration, you can enable or disable the support button by configuring the option in **Setup** > **Onboarding**  page in the WiFi Portal card.

### FreshWorks

In order to integrate your FreshDesk widget inside the WiFi Portal, you need to create a Widget and retrieve its ID.

Go to **Admin** and select **Widgets**. Create and configure a new Widget. You can change all the settings of the widget, including labels and theme directly in the FresWorks dashboard.

Click on the button **Embed**. A dialog with the widget code will appear.

Find the part of the code 'widget\_id': and copy the value next to it, such as 204000000218 in the example above.

In Cusna, select New integration and select FreshWorks. In the Widget ID filed, enter the value you just copied.
