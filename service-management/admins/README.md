# Admins

When logged in as Organization admin, under **General** > **Admins**, you can manage all the account users, including other **Organization admins** and **Network managers**.

Organization admins can have two **permissions** scopes:

* **Admins**: can configure the account, including Settings, Network and Accounts
* **Account managers**: can only manage Accounts

When you edit or create an Org Manager, you can elect it to become the **Account Owner**. Account Owner is the admin account that has the permission to manage other Admins.&#x20;

Toggle the option "Invite as Owner" to elect the Admin as owner.
