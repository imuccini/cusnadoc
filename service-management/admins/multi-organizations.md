# Multi Organizations

Sometimes, large companies might need to use multiple Cusna accounts. In this cases, one Org Admin can be enabled to manage multiple Organizations. This can happen when the company has multiple independent sub-brands with different management teams.



When a admin is assigned to an Organization, the user can simply pick to organization to manage form the **organization picker** menu.
